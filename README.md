## Setup and Deployment (GitHub Pages)

This portfolio is designed to be easily hosted on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vidyasagar786/vidyasagar.git
    cd vidyasagar
    ```

2.  **Switch to the Feature Branch (if not already on it):**
    ```bash
    git checkout feature/portfolio-redesign
    ```
    *(Note: If you want to merge these changes into your `main` branch, you would typically create a Pull Request on GitHub from `feature/portfolio-redesign` to `main`.)*

3.  **Local Preview (Optional):**
    To view the website locally, you can use a simple Python HTTP server:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

4.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
    *   Ensure your project is pushed to your GitHub repository.
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to `Settings` > `Pages`.
    *   Under "Build and deployment," select `Deploy from a branch`.
    *   Choose the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or `feature/portfolio-redesign`) and the `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Click `Save`.
    *   Your site will be deployed to `https://Vidyasagar786.github.io/vidyasagar/` (or your custom domain if configured). It may take a few minutes for the changes to go live.
